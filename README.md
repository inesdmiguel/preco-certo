# Preço Certo

## Description
Preço Certo is a group project developed during Games Week, at <Academia de Código_>’s Full-Stack Programming Bootcamp.

What references can bring together 4 very different students at the bootcamp? We didn’t know each other very well, but we had one thing in common: we were all Portuguese, so we shared the same cultural references in that sense. Preço Certo is a very typical game-show in the Portuguese public TV channel - RTP1. It has been on every weekday since 2002, and the iconic presenter Fernando Mendes can bring a smile to anyone’s face.

The challenge was to develop a game in a week. By this stage at the bootcamp, we knew the basics of Java programming and had become familiar with the graphics library Simple Graphics (which is, indeed, very simple). Joining our forces together, with each person playing to their strengths, this is the game that resulted in a win for our team.
